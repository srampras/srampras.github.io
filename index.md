I am a postdoctoral associate in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Minnesota. My undergraduate degree was in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the [National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli](https://nitt.edu/home/academics/departments/ece/) in 2009, followed by a PhD from the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2002](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in).

I primarily work on Electronic Design Automation Algorithms, specifically on automation Back End of Line flow for custom digital, and analog/mixed signal designs. 

In the past, I have worked on Statistical Static Timing Analysis at IBM, Custom Routing at Synopsys, and Machine Learning for SoC design at Qualcomm.
