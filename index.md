I am an assistant professor in the [Integrated Circuits Group](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ics) at the [Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Madras](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in). Prior to this I was a postdoc in [Prof. Sachin Sapatnekar](https://www.ece.umn.edu/~sachin)'s lab at University of Minnesota. My undergraduate degree was in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the [National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli](https://nitt.edu/home/academics/departments/ece/) in 2009, followed by a PhD from the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2016](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in).

I primarily work on Electronic Design Automation Algorithms, specifically on automation of Back End of Line (BEOL) flow for custom digital, and analog/mixed-signal (AMS) designs. I have contributed to the placer and router in an open-source AMS layout generator named [ALIGN](https://github.com/ALIGN-analoglayout/ALIGN-public.git). During my stint at Synopsys, I was also involved the development of various tools that are now part of the [Custom Compiler](https://www.synopsys.com/implementation-and-signoff/custom-design-platform/custom-compiler.html) platform.
