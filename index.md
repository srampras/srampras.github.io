I am an Assistant Professor in the [Integrated Circuits Group](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ics) at the [Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Madras](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in). I primarily work on Electronic Design Automation (EDA) Algorithms, specifically on automation of Back End of Line (BEOL) flow for custom digital, and analog/mixed-signal (AMS) designs. 

My undergraduate degree was in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the [National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli](https://nitt.edu/home/academics/departments/ece/) in 2009, followed by a PhD advised by [Prof. Vinita Vasudevan](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~vinita) from the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2016](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in). I was a postdoc in [Prof. Sachin Sapatnekar](https://www.ece.umn.edu/~sachin)'s lab at University of Minnesota between 2020-23. 

I have contributed to the placer and router in an open-source AMS layout generator, [ALIGN](https://github.com/ALIGN-analoglayout/ALIGN-public.git). I worked for Synopsys after PhD, during which time I was involved the development of various tools that are now part of the [Custom Compiler platform](https://www.synopsys.com/implementation-and-signoff/custom-design-platform/custom-compiler.html). I have recently started working on mapping NP-hard and complete problems to Ising machines. You are welcome to get in touch if you  would like to pursue a MS/PhD degree and are interested in working in EDA or other combinatorial optimization problems.
